"""
Postmark inbound email webhook.

Setup in Postmark:
  1. Create an Inbound Domain (e.g. track.tydline.com) in your Postmark account.
  2. Set the Inbound Webhook URL to: https://your-api.tydline.com/api/v1/email/inbound
  3. Enable HTTP Basic Auth on the webhook and set credentials that match
     POSTMARK_INBOUND_SECRET in .env (format: "username:password").
     The endpoint verifies this as an Authorization: Basic <b64> header.
  4. Importers forward or CC their shipping emails to: anything@track.tydline.com

The webhook receives Postmark's parsed email JSON, matches the sender to a
registered user by email address, extracts container numbers, links shipments,
stores the record, and feeds context into Mem0 for the agent.
